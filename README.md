# Stock market Investment prediction
## Designing a Minimum viable product Solution for Financial Consultation (FC), Toronto by DSSC

## Problem Statement:
  The challenge is creating a machine-learning model to forecast the stock market and make data-driven predictions. Financial Institutions may speed their decisions to enhance client satisfaction and make data-driven decisions while lowering the default risk factor using this ML model.
 
  This project aims to deliver a Minimum Viable Product for a major finance company called Financial Consultation (FC) in Toronto. FC offers financial consultations to clients who want to invest in the stock market. This project is mainly designed using Python. It is in the best interest of DSSC to provide a deliverable product to the said company to improve investments shortly. Every part of this project shows a sample code to perform the following:
•	Collecting data (using APIs) 
•	Stores it in databases or Data Sources (relational, or no relational databases, or even object storage options such as AWS S3) 
•	Loads the data from the database or data source 
•	Use of a task management system such as Trello 
•	Use of a source code management system such as GitHub
•	Data manipulation (dealing with missing values, errors in data, anomalies, etc.) 
•	Data Exploration - Explore the data using data exploration techniques, including visualization.  
•	Data Visualisation 
•	Provides AI/ML or Statistical analysis  
•	Result of the analysis. 
•	Minimum Viable Product Deliverable

## Dependencies and Libraries required:
•	Pandas
•	Seaborn
•	Matplotlib
•	SQLite
•	Scikit-learn
•	DateTime

This project is performed in weekly sprints; hence, weekly updates are provided step by step.

## Week 1:
•	Setting up Trello board. https://trello.com/invite/alphavision8/ATTI37d2e5d43a35afc41a16feb8d3bbc8ed695F5C79  
•	Setting up a source code repository for the project, inviting all collaborators, and setting up a proper README.md for the git repository that explains the purpose of the project and its key components. Setting up a branch and code review structure for better coding practices. https://github.com/Anirudh8Sharma/AlphaVision 
•	The programming language(s) that will be used for programming the MVP and their respective versions (e.g., Python 3.9) and their libraries
•	The Data Science approaches to analyze the data.
•	Database design and Data  Storage
